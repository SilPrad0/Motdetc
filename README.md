# Motion Detection Project 📹
This is a simple motion detection project built using Python and OpenCV, designed to detect motion in a video stream or live feed from a camera. It uses computer vision techniques provided by the OpenCV library to analyze consecutive frames and identify regions where motion occurs.
It starts recording once there's movement detected, it saves the video on .avi in a specified file.
